176
00:09:19.035 --> 00:09:20.446
in the Kanto region!

177
00:09:20.446 --> 00:09:22.739
And, this is my
good buddy Pikachu.

178
00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:23.830
Nice to meet you!

179
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.371
PIKACHU: [GREETING]

180
00:09:25.952 --> 00:09:27.243
ASH: So ... What is this place?

181
00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:30.877
MALLOW: It's the Pokémon School.

182
00:09:31.247 --> 00:09:34.630
ASH: I've heard of the
Pokémon School! Whaddaya know.

183
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.922
This is it.

184
00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:38.054
MALLOW:
I guess you must've gotten lost.

185
00:09:38.054 --> 00:09:39.295
ASH: I guess...

186
00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:40.967
MALLOW: I'll show you around!

187
00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:42.138
ASH: Really?

188
00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:43.509
BOUNSWEET: [EXCITED]

189
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:45.892
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

190
00:09:45.892 --> 00:09:47.263
MALLOW: Come on, this way!

191
00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:49.265
ASH: Hey,
you don't have to pull so hard!

192
00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:55.231
ASH: "Who's that Pokémon?"

193
00:09:58.735 --> 00:10:02.528
ASH: "It's Grubbin!"

194
00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:08.825
ASH: Check it OUT!

195
00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:10.416
What's that?!

196
00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:12.709
So cool! Awesome!

197
00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:22.008
ASH: This's great.
Where am I again?

198
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:25.431
MALLOW: I told you.
It's the Pokémon School!

199
00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:28.144
MALLOW: It's a place
where Pokémon and students

200
00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:29.435
all study together.

201
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.903
MALLOW: Principal, sir?
I brought a new student.

202
00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:37.904
ASH: A new student?!

203
00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.319
DELIA: Ash! You finally made it.

204
00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.530
ASH: It's my mom!

205
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.491
DELIA: Glad you can join us.

206
00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:50.076
SAMSON: Alola, Ash!
Welcome to the Pokémon School,

207
00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:51.828
home of Solrock and roll!

208
00:10:51.828 --> 00:10:53.459
ASH: Professor Oak,
what are you doing here?

209
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:56.873
SAMSON:
People tell me we look alike.

210
00:10:56.873 --> 00:10:59.135
I guess that's why
you recognized me.

211
00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:00.296
The name is Samson Oak.

212
00:11:00.797 --> 00:11:02.638
MALLOW: He's the
Pokémon School principal.

213
00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:04.971
SAMSON: Nice to meet chew!

214
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:07.513
ASH:
Uh, nice to meet you, too ...

215
00:11:07.513 --> 00:11:08.765
MALLOW: He always makes jokes.

216
00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:11.017
Playing around
with Pokémon names.

217
00:11:11.017 --> 00:11:12.688
SAMSON:
We all need a little fun.

218
00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:14.390
A little dose of levity

219
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.393
and laughter is
what MY RANT IS FOR!

220
00:11:17.393 --> 00:11:18.985
PIKACHU/BOUNSWEET: [AWKWARD]

221
00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:23.820
ASH: And after
we chased after Charizard,

222
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.321
we just kind of wound up here.

223
00:11:26.282 --> 00:11:28.785
MALLOW: So that means...
you're really not a new

224
00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:30.076
student here after all.

225
00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:32.708
ASH: I guess I never
really got a chance to explain.

226
00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:34.080
MALLOW: It's my fault.

227
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.541
I'm in such a
hurry all the time,

228
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:36.542
I can miss things.

229
00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:39.796
SAMSON: Hey, Samuel! It's me!

230
00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:42.758
I got your Egg safe and sound!

231
00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:45.091
PROFESSOR OAK:
Excellent, Samson!

232
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:46.762
That's what I like to hear.

233
00:11:46.762 --> 00:11:48.384
Thanks to you, Delia.

234
00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:50.516
DELIA:
It's my greatest pleasure.

235
00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:52.558
MALLOW: Say, Principal Oak sir?

236
00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:54.690
May I show Ash
around the campus?

237
00:11:56.022 --> 00:11:58.144
SAMSON: Of course!
PoryGON your way ...

238
00:11:58.144 --> 00:12:00.066
MALLOW: Ready to go, Ash?

239
00:12:01.197 --> 00:12:03.149
MALLOW:
Now this is our classroom.

240
00:12:09.866 --> 00:12:11.207
ASH: Wow ...

241
00:12:11.207 --> 00:12:12.208
PIKACHU: [CAPTIVATED]

242
00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:13.079
ASH: This is so nice!

243
00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:15.161
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

244
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:17.453
MALLOW: And that's not all!
There's also the field where you

245
00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:21.547
met Tauros, and there's the lake
and ... the campus is huge and

246
00:12:21.547 --> 00:12:23.669
we learn all
sorts of amazing things.

247
00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:25.962
PROFESSOR KUKUI: Hi!

248
00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:27.383
PROFESSOR KUKUI:
A big Alola to you all!

249
00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:29.225
MALLOW: Professor Kukui!

250
00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:30.556
ASH: Professor?

251
00:12:30.556 --> 00:12:31.968
MALLOW: Yeah, he's our teacher!

252
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:34.600
Professor!
I'd like you to meet Ash!

253
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.143
PROFESSOR KUKUI:
Principal Oak just filled me in.

254
00:12:37.143 --> 00:12:38.774
Hi, Ash, Pikachu.

255
00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:41.147
The Pokémon School
is a wonderful place!

256
00:12:41.147 --> 00:12:42.939
PROFESSOR KUKUI: I hope
you enjoy your visit here!

257
00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:44.740
ASH: Thank you!

258
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.611
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

259
00:12:48.824 --> 00:12:49.825
ASH: Who are they?

260
00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:54.871
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
Stopping our bikes the way you

261
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:56.662
did was not the
smartest of moves.

262
00:12:57.203 --> 00:12:58.875
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLACK):
Yeah, just like my bro said.

263
00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:00.296
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
Team Skull doesn't

264
00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:01.958
like anyone getting in our way.

265
00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.589
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (PINK):
You've got that right!

266
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.502
KIAWE: I don't
remember blocking the road.

267
00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:09.005
The only people I can see
getting in the way are you.

268
00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:11.597
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
Well, listen to the big talker.

269
00:13:12.468 --> 00:13:14.310
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLACK):
I dare you to say that again!

270
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.721
ASH: Who are those guys?

271
00:13:16.352 --> 00:13:18.224
MALLOW:
They're part of Team Skull.

272
00:13:18.224 --> 00:13:20.816
Always bullying us
into a Pokémon battle.

273
00:13:20.816 --> 00:13:22.108
Not nice.

274
00:13:22.648 --> 00:13:24.690
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE): If you
can beat us in a Pokémon battle,

275
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.692
maybe we'll let you walk away...

276
00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:28.905
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLACK):
Yeah, but if we beat you,

277
00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:31.527
then that Charizard
of yours belongs to us!

278
00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:33.529
KIAWE: You'll be sorry...

279
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:35.912
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
Ha! We'll see about that.

280
00:13:36.492 --> 00:13:38.034
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
Come on out, Salandit!

281
00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:39.035

282

MALLOW: But Ash!

290
00:13:58.014 --> 00:13:59.395
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLACK):
Who do you think you are?

291
00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:01.607
ASH: You're cowards!
Ganging up three against one ...

292
00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.110
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
What are you gonna do about it?

293
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.234
ASH: I'll fight, too!
Are you ready? And you're ...

294
00:14:08.234 --> 00:14:11.277
KIAWE: Kiawe.
But I don't need any help.

295
00:14:11.277 --> 00:14:13.329
MALLOW: Those guys are
really dangerous, Ash!

296
00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.201
ASH: Pikachu! Ready?

297
00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:16.993

KIAWE: Don't hurt yourself.

302
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.583

304
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:38.474

So that's a Turtonator, huh?

305
00:14:39.095 --> 00:14:40.436
KIAWE: A Fire and Dragon type.

306
00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.768
A strong and
trusted friend.

307
00:14:42.768 --> 00:14:43.899
A wise one.

308
00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:45.151
TEAM SKULL GRUNT (BLUE):
Now, Salandit!

309
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:47.773

KIAWE:
If something touches the spines

322
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:14.970
on a Turtonator's shell,
they'll blow up.

323
